Analyzing Tiket.com Review Using IBM Granite Model

**Project overview**
Project Overview – Tiket.com Review Analysis
Objective
This project analyzes employee reviews of Tiket.com (sourced from Glassdoor, Jan 2023 – Aug 2025, total 206 reviews) using IBM Granite AI for data classification and summarization. The goal is to identify key strengths and areas of improvement that can inform strategic planning, increase job satisfaction, reduce turnover, and enhance employee well-being.

Process
1. Data collection from Glassdoor.
2. Data cleaning and preparation.
3. Input into AI model (IBM Granite).
4. Prompt engineering (refinement for accuracy).
5. Extract insights and classify themes.
6. Formulate strategic recommendations.

Key Insights
1. Overall Rating: Average 4.22/5 (91.75% rated ≥3, but only 51.46% gave 5 stars).
2. Positives: Salary & benefits, good work-life balance (flexibility), supportive environment, and learning opportunities.
3. Negatives: Poor leadership, lack of recognition, high workload, unclear career paths, toxic environment, and subjective 4. evaluations.

Recommendations
Leadership & Management: Improve leadership skills, communication, and culture.
Career Paths: Build transparent and merit-based promotion systems.
Work-Life Balance: Redistribute workload, set realistic targets, and offer flexibility.
Performance Appraisal: Ensure fair and objective evaluations.
Employee Development: Invest in continuous learning and training programs.

Strategic Plan
Short-term (3–6 months)
Transition communication from WhatsApp to project management tools.
Conduct pulse surveys & town halls.
Run leadership workshops (active listening, empathy).

Mid-term (1–3 years)
Clarify career paths & promotion criteria.
Launch technical & soft skill development programs.
Revamp performance evaluation with objective metrics.
Long-term (3–10 years)
Redesign organizational structure for clarity & collaboration.
Build inclusive, fair, and positive company culture.
Modernize technology stack to improve efficiency and satisfaction.

Future Application
This method can be scaled for continuous employee voice analysis, leveraging AI for organizational insights while ensuring anonymity, which research (Suler, 2004 – Online Disinhibition Effect) suggests encourages more open employee feedback.
